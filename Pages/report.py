    st.write("""
    - Electric Utilities tend to **stay flat or slightly rise** before hurricanes → markets *do not price risk early*  
    - Water Utilities sometimes **decline before floods** → pricing of operational disruption  
    - Renewable Energy (TAN) is **most volatile before events** – high speculation

    st.subheader("Day of Disaster (T)")
    st.write("""
    - Most industries show a **sharp negative reaction at T or T+1**  
    - Oil & Gas (XLE) sometimes rises → expectation of supply disruption  
    - **Evidence of underpricing disaster risk before T**  
    """)

    st.subheader("Recovery After Disaster (T → T+3)")
    st.write("""
    - Electric & Multi-Utilities show **early recovery**
    - Water Utilities often recover **much slower**
    - Hypothesis: utilities are viewed as **essential & regulated**, so markets expect quick stabilization

    st.subheader("Extended Behavior (T+10)")
    st.write("""
    - XLU & IDU often return to positive CAR by T+10  
    - PHO and TAN show **higher long-term volatility**  
    - XLE tends to move opposite utilities (possible hedge)

    st.subheader("Overall Takeaways")
    st.write("""
    ✔ Markets generally **underreact BEFORE disasters**, suggesting inefficiency  
    ✔ Recovery speed varies by industry – **evidence of different risk perceptions**  
    ✔ Some assets may act as **disaster hedges** (XLE, TAN)
